Introducing a new generation of gambling where you can only profit.

SnakeSnake is not about the game, but about the gambling model that drives it and its community.
Players earn in-game currency by nothing more than playing the game, where money is generated by advertising and mining Monero in the background.
All revenue is made collectively by the community and is fairly injected back in.

Once a player has enough in-game currency, they will have two options. 
They can either cash out, transferring all their proceeds to their Monero wallet.
Or they can use the in-game currency as a buy-in to enter paid rooms. In these rooms, it is guaranteed that every player has also paid the buy-in fee. When they defeat another player, they will earn the defeated player's buy-in fee as their own. Allowing the player's to earn money at their own rate.
